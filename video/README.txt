Place your demo video file(s) here:
- demo.mp4  (required for the product and how-it-works video player)
- demo.webm (optional, for better browser support)

If these files are missing, the video player will show the poster image (1.png) and the browser may show 404 in the console. Adding demo.mp4 here will fix that.
